        In today's market, buyers have many options and choose to go without a
        buyer agent altogether whilst reaching out to Listing agents directly.
        We believe that in order to meet your desired budget and if there would
        be some maintenance needed to the home that is being purchased, a
        buyer's agent is crucial as the Listing agent's priority is to serve in
        the best interest of the Homeowner.

        We believe in honesty, integrity, professionalism, and giving the right
        advice to our Homeowner clients. We price homes as they should be
        because giving a massive price tag to a home that is not up to a
        specific par can have the home sitting on the market for too long,
        especially with too many options in today's market. Therefore, choosing
        the right agent to sell your home is the most important decision to make
        as a Homeowner.
